<h2 align="start" id="About">About</h2>
Thinking about it..

<h2 align="start" id="Inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
Given the crucial importance of women's safety and security everywhere, I wanted to contribute by creating a solution that is simple, safe, and feature-rich. This app is designed not only to enhance safety but also to empowering users to feel both secure and confident.
<br><br>
<b>As there are many women safety app but majority of them lacks simplity and ease to use Interface and filled with a lots of clutter and b& (can't use another synonym but you may know) and is hard to navigate. There was no distinction between the essential services and additonal services.</b> 
<br><br>
<b>So, Keeping this in mind decided to develop an app which is ease to use with simplicity in UI but keeping features and seprating the essentials and additional features and services and trying to make it robust.</b>
